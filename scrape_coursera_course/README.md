# Task

For this task, you will be creating a Python script that scrapes course info from coursera.org

The script should have an interface where you can enter a category name corresponding to a Coursera category such as Data Science: <https://www.coursera.org/browse/data-science>

Then the script will collect all courses from this category and place them into a CSV file. Here is the info that is required from each course:

Course name
Course provider
Course description

number of Students enrolled

number of Ratings

Here is an example CSV file for this course page.

Once you are done, upload your CSV file to the internet and submit the live URL to your CSV file in this form here: <https://forms.gle/rCGGTsdgVXQ1594p7>
